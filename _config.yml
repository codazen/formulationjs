  This project was created to allow developers to save time and complexity out
  of building forms. With FormulationJS, anyone can quickly build submission 
  forms using JSON objects, which is then rendered in React. The generated 
  forms can be integrated with third-party applications for desktops and mobile
  browsers. In the future, we would like to build a more comprehensive set of
  inputs and other functional form features along with a UI to build the forms 
  and API's to get, update, or save the submitted data.
