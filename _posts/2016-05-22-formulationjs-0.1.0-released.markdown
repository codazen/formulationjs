Codazen is excited to open source and release our first version of Formulation - <a href="https://github.com/codazen/formulationjs/releases/tag/0.1.0" target="_blank">Release 0.1.0</a>!

This library was created to allow developers to save time by taking the complexity out of building forms. With FormulationJS, anyone can quickly build web forms using JSON objects and render them in ReactJS. The generated forms can be integrated with third-party applications for both desktops and mobile browsers. Keep an eye out for a more comprehensive set of inputs and other functional form features, including a UI to design forms without JSON and API's to get, update, or save submitted data.

Special thanks to Lance Lee, Shivani Patel, Aaron Joseph, Thomas Georghe, and Steven Nguyen at UCI for getting this project started.
